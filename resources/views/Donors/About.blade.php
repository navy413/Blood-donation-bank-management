            <p>
                We created this website to be a center for people who want to buy or donate blood.
                Instead of waiting, you can buy blood with just a click.<br>
                Whenever you want to donate, you can check the places where the blood is needed.
                Our goal is to participate in covering the national needs for blood in transfusion ,and its derivatives of good quality, and to care about its availability for those in need.
                Lastly, to facilitate and encourage the blood donations for those who have the ability to help those who need it.
